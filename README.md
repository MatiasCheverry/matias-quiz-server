This proyect is a multiplayer quiz app that I built for dekabeza's challenge.

Technologies used:

-node.js
-sequelize
-postgres
-express.js

The interface is very simple:

You type your nickname and log in. Then you have a specified time to answer all the questions.
The timer is running at the server so all users see the live countdown. Each second, it emmits the remaining seconds to all users.

-When you log in the nickname and all the user data is saved in localstorage so you don't have to log in again.

-When you press "log out" you're redirected to the login page and the localstorage is cleared.

I've had a lot of fun building this simple app. It's likely that I continue to develop it since I want to add functionalities and improve the existing ones.
You can see the proyect deployed at:
